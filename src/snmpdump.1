.SH NAME
snmpdump \- extract SNMP messages from pcap trace files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpdump
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsnmpdump\fP extract SNMP messages out of pcap trace files and
renders the messages in an XML format which can be easily processed
using scripts written in scripting languages such as Perl. Sensitive
data can be filtered or removed.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBsnmpdump\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
\fB-a, --anon\fP
Anonymize the trace. The anonymization rules are currently hardwired
and very restrictive and cannot be changed without recompiling the
program.
.TP
\fB-c \fIfile\fB, --config=\fIfile\fP
Read \fIfile\fP instead of any other (global and user)
libsmi configuration file.
.TP
\fB-f \fIexpression\fB, --filter=\fIexpression\fP
Filter the input by applying the pcap filter \fIexpression\fR to the
packets before they are processed by snmpdump. This option can only
be used once.
.TP
\fB-i \fIformat\fB, --input=\fIformat\fP
Process input of the given \fIformat\fP. The current version of
snmpdump can process XML input and PCAP input. The default input
format is PCAP.
.TP
\fB-o \fIformat\fB, --output=\fIformat\fP
Produce output of the given \fIformat\fP. The current version of
snmpdump can generate XML output and CSV output. The default output
format is XML.
.TP
\fB-p \fItext\fB, --passphrase=\fItext\fP
Provide a passphrase \fItext\fP as a parameter to the anonymization
transformations. This option has only effect if anonymization is
enabled. Note that specifying a passphrase on the comand line is a
security risk since it might be visible in process lists.
.TP
\fB-m \fIfile\fB \-\-module \fIfile\fB
Load SMI MIB module definitions from \fIfile\fP.  This option can be
used several times to load several MIB modules into snmpanon.
.TP
\fB-z \fIregex\fB, --zap=\fIregex\fP
Clear all attributes or elements in the XML document whose name
matches \fIregex\fR. The regular expression \fIregex\fR is a case
insensitive extended POSIX regular expression.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-flows
Extract flows and write the output to several files which are named
after the flows. Any existing files will be overwritten. Messages that
cannot be assigned to flows will be written to standard output.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following command converts SNMP traces stored in the file
'trace.pcap' into XML format.
.PP 
.RS 
\f(CWsnmpdump trace.pcap\fP
.RE
.PP 
To zero out all community strings, you can use the following command
line:
.PP
.RS
\f(CWsnmpdump -c 'community' trace.pcap\fP
.RE
.PP
To filter out all vlen and blen attributes, use the following command
line:
.PP
.RS
\f(CWsnmpdump -c 'vlen|blen' trace.pcap\fP
.RE
.PP
To filter out only certain SNMP packets from a given source using a
non-standard port number, you can use the pcap filtering mechanism:
.PP 
.RS 
\f(CWsnmpdump -f 'udp and port 1161 and host 10.20.30.40' trace.pcap\fP
.RE
