Abstract

   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is widely deployed to
   monitor, control and configure network elements.  Even though the
   principal behavior of SNMP is well understood, it remains unclear how
   SNMP is used in practice.  In particular, it is not clear which
   features are being used, how SNMP usage differs in different types of
   organizations, which information is frequently queried, and what
   typical SNMP interactions patterns are in real world networks.  These

   questions recently became important as researchers started to
   investigate the application of other protocols (such as Web Services)
   for network management purposes.

1.  Introduction

   There have been several papers in the recent past dealing with the
   performance of SNMP in general, the impact of SNMPv3 security and the
   relative performance of SNMP compared to Web Services.  While these
   papers are useful to better understand the impact of various design
   decisions and technologies, these papers in general lack a strong
   foundation because authors often typically assume certain SNMP
   interaction patterns without having experimental evidence that the
   assumptions are correct.  In fact, there are many speculations and
   opinions how SNMP is being used and how it performs, but no
   systematic measurements have been done and published so far.

   Many authors have used the ifTable of the IF-MIB or the tcpConnTable
   of the TCP-MIB as a foundation for their analysis and comparisons.
   Despite the fact that it is not even clear that these tables dominate
   the SNMP traffic, it is even more unclear how these tables are read
   and which optimizations are done (or not done) by real world
   applications.  It is also unclear what the actual traffic trade-off
   between periodic polling and bulk data retrieval really is.
   Furthermore, we do not generally understand how much traffic is
   devoted to standardized MIB objects and how much traffic deals with
   proprietary MIB objects and whether the operation mix differes
   between those object classes or between different operational
   environments.

   This document describes an effort to collect SNMP traffic traces for
   analysis.  It also describes the tools that have been developed to
   allow network operators to collect traffic traces and to share them
   with research groups.

2.  Measurement Approach

   The process of doing SNMP measurements is outlined below.  It
   consists of the following steps:

   1.  Capture the SNMP traffic into a pcap capture file.  This can be
       easily done by using tools such as tcpdump or ethereal.
   2.  Convert the pcap traffic traces into a structured machine and
       human readable file format.  The natural choice here is to use
       XML.  Appendix A contains the RELAX NG schema definition for this
       purpose.  During the conversion process, data may be anonymized
       in order to reduce the likelihood that sensitive data leaks into
       places where it does not belong.
   3.  Filter the converted traffic XML traces to hide information that
       is considered sensitive.  This filterting can be accomplished by
       running an xslt processor such as xsltproc on the XML traffic
       trace.

   4.  Submit the filtered traffic traces to a central repository,
       allowing researchers to retrieve traffic traces from the central
       repository and to post-process them in order to produce
       meaningful results.  An alternative option is to keep the data on
       the operators side and to run cooperate with researches by
       running their analysis scripts on the converted XML traffic
       traces.

   Most of the steps listed above require involvement of the network
   operators supporting the SNMP measurement project.  In most cases,
   the XML notation of the SNMP traces will be the binding interface
   between the researchers providing analysis scripts and the operators
   involved in the measurement activity.

   This document provides advise and hints for network operators how the
   steps listed above can be carried out efficiently.  Some special
   tools have been developed to assist operators so that the time spend
   on supporting this project is limited.  The following sections will
   describe the various steps and tools in more detail.

2.1  Capturing Traffic Traces

   Capturing SNMP traffic traces can be done by using tcpdump [1] or
   similar applications.  Note, care must be taken to specify a filter
   expression that matches the SNMP transport endpoints used for SNMP
   (typically 'udp and (port 161 or port 162)').  Furthermore, it is
   necessary to ensure that packets are not truncated (tcpdump option -s
   0).  Finally, it is necessary to carefully select the placement of
   the probe within the network.  Especially on bridged LANs, it is
   important to ensure that all management traffic is captured and that
   the probe has access to the virtual LANs carrying management traffic.
   This usually requires to place the probe(s) close to the management
   system(s).

   It is recommended to capture at least a full week of data.  But
   operators are encourages to capture longer traffic traces.  Tools
   such as tcpslice [1] or pcapmerge [2] can be used to merge or split
   trace files.

2.2  Converting Traffic Traces

   Raw traffic traces in pcap format must be converted into an XML
   representation.  The snmpdump [3] package has been developed for this
   purpose.  The snmpdump program reads pcap files and produces an XML
   document which lists the details of the SNMP packets contained in the
   traffic trace.  The Relax NG schema definition of the XML format can
   be found in Appendix A.  The snmpdump implementation is able to
   reassemble IPv4 fragments.  However, it does current not support

   IPv6.

   The snmpdump program can filter out sensitive information.  Work is
   in progress to provide data type specific anonymization capabilities
   which maintain the semantic meaning of the values and maintain the
   lexicographic ordering property.

2.3  Filtering Traffic Traces

   Some additional filtering can be implemented by manipulating the XML
   representation of an SNMP trace.  Standard XSLT processors such as
   xsltproc [4] can be used for this purpose.  People familiar with Perl
   might also be interested in using the XML::LibXML [5] Perl package to
   manipulate XML documents from within Perl.

2.4  Submitting/Analyzing Traffic Traces

   The pcap traces together with the XML traces should be stored in an
   archive.  Such an archive might either be maintained by researchers
   or research groups (e.g. the NMRG) or by the operators themself.  It
   is however of key importance that captured traces are not lost or
   modified as they form the basis of future research projects and may
   also be needed to verify published research results.  Access to the
   archive might be restricted to those who have signed some sort of a
   non-disclosure agreement.

   Note that lossless compression algorithms embodied in programs such
   as gzip or bzip2 can be used to compress even large traces files down
   to a size where they can be burned on DVD roms for cheap longterm
   storage.

2.5  Processing Traffic Traces

   Trace files can be processed with tools written in almost any
   programming language.  However, in order to facilitate a common
   vocabulary and to allow operators to easily read scripts they execute
   on trace files, it is suggested that analysis scripts are written in
   the Perl programming language using the XML::LibXML [5] Perl package
   to read the XML format of the trace files.

   TBD: show a skeleton of a Perl script file; put a full working
   example into the appendix.
