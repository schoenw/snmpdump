          The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) started an
          activity to collect traces of the Simple Network Management
          Protocol (SNMP) from operational networks. To analyze these
          traces, it is necessary to split potentially large traces
          into more manageable pieces that make it easier to deal
          with large data sets and simplify the analysis of the data.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document provides some common definitions that have
          been found useful for implementing tools to support trace
          analysis. This document mainly serves as a reference for the
          definitions underlying these tools and it is not meant to
          explain all the motivation and reasoning behind the
          definitions. Some of this background information can be
          found in other research papers.

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The Simple Network Management Protocol (SMMP) was introduced
        in the late 1980s. Since then, several protocol changes have
        taken place, which have eventually led to what is known today
        as the SNMP version 3 framework (SNMPv3) <xref
        target="RFC3410"/><xref target="RFC3411"/>. Extensive use of
        SNMP has led to significant practical experience by both
        network operators and researchers. However, up until now only
        little research has been done on characterizing and modeling
        SNMP traffic.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since recently, network researchers are in the possession of
        network traces, including SNMP traces captured on operational
        networks. The availability of SNMP traces enables research on
        characterizing and modeling real world SNMP traffic. However,
        experience with SNMP traces has shown that the traces must be
        large enough in order to make proper observations. A more
        detailed motivation for collecting SNMP traces and guidelines
	on how to capture SNMP traces can be found in <xref
        target="ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Unfortunately, the analysis of large SNMP traces can take a
        large amount of processing time. Therefore, it is often
        desirable to focus the analysis on smaller, relevant sections
        of a trace.  This in turn requires a proper way to identify
        these smaller sections of a trace. This document describes a
        number of identifiable sections within a trace which make
        specific research on these smaller sections more practical.
        The following figure shows the various sections of traces and
        how they relate to each other.

      <t>
        This document defines the various entities (boxes) shown in
        the above figure. These definitions can be implemented by
        tools that can split SNMP traces into smaller sections for
        further analysis.
      </t>
      <t>
        The most central entity in the figure above is an SNMP trace,
        consisting of a potentially large set of SNMP messages. An
        SNMP trace is the result of recording SNMP traffic on a
        specific network for a specific time duration. Such a trace
        may, depending on the number of hosts in the respective
        network, contain SNMP messages exchanged between possibly many
        different SNMP engines. The messages contained in a trace may
        be represented in different formats. For the purpose of this
        document, the simple comma separated values (CSV) format
        defined in <xref target="ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE"/> contains
        sufficient information to split a trace into smaller sections.
      </t>
      <t>
        The SNMP messages belonging to an SNMP trace may have been
        exchanged between many different SNMP engines running on
        different hosts. Therefore, a first obvious way of separating
        a trace into smaller sets of SNMP messages is the separation
        of a trace into flows. Each flow contains only those SNMP
        messages of an SNMP trace that have been exchanged between two
        network endpoints. Such a separation may be necessary in case
        one wants to analyze specific SNMP traffic characteristics
        (e.g., number of agents managed by a management station) and
        wants to rule out network endpoint specific behaviour (e.g.,
        different SNMP management stations may have different polling
        configurations).
      </t>
      <t>
        Flows within traces can still be quite large in terms of the
        number of messages they contain. Therefore, it may be
        necessary to split a flow into even smaller sections called
        slices. A slice contains all SNMP messages of a given flow
        that are related to each other in time and referenced
        information. Splitting a flow into slices makes it possible to
        separate SNMP messages within traces that belong to each
        other.
      </t>
      <t>
	For example, a slice may contain the exchanged SNMP messages
	between an agent and a manager, which polls that agent in a
	single polling instance.  The manager may be configured to
	poll that agent every once in a while. If the requested
	information from the agent remains unchanged, then the
	respective slices of SNMP traffic occurring between this
	manager and agent will be highly comparable.  In such a case
	the slices will be of the same slice type. Similar slices will
	thus be considered of the same slice type and incomparable
	slices will not be of the same slice type.
      </t>
      <t>
        Besides the fact that each slice is of specific slice type,
        slices can also be of a specific form with respect to the
        messages encompassing a slice.  For example, slices containing
        a sequence of linked GetNext or GetBulk requests are commonly
        called an SNMP walk.  Note that only a subset of all slices
        will be walks.

    <section anchor="messages" title="Messages">

      <t>
        SNMP messages carry PDUs associated with well defined specific
        protocol operations <xref target="RFC3416"/>. The PDUs can be
        used to classify SNMP messages. Following are a number of
        definitions that help to classify SNMP messages based on the
        PDU contained in them. These definitions will be used later on
        in this document.

        Notation: Let M be an SNMP message. The properties of M are
        denoted as follows:

   M.tdst    = transport layer destination endpoint of message M
   M.nsrc    = network layer source endpoint of message M
   M.ndst    = network layer destination endpoint of message M

   M.values  = values listed in varbind list of message M
   ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        Note that the properties of a message can be easily extracted
        from the exchange formats defined in RFC XXXX
        <xref target="ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (read request message): A read request message is a
        message M containing a PDU of type GetRequest, GetNextRequest,
        or GetBulkRequest.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (write request message): A write request message is
        a message M containing a PDU of type SetRequest.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (notification request message): A notification
        request message is a message M containing a PDU of type
        InformRequest.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (notification message): A notification message is a
        message M containing a PDU of type Trap or InformRequest.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (request message): A request message is a message M
        which is either a read request message, a write request
        message, or a notification request message.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Definition (response message): A response message is a message
        M containing a PDU of type Response or of type Report.
      </t>

      <t>
        Note that Report messages are treated like Response messages
        since the SNMPv3 specifications currently use Report messages
        only as an error reporting mechanism, always triggered by the
        processing of some request messages. In case future SNMP
        versions or extensions use Report messages without having a
        request triggering the generation of Report messages, the
        definition above may need to be revisted.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (non-response message): A non-response message is a
        message M which is either a read request message, a write
        request message, or a notification message.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (command message): A command message is a message M
        which is either a read request message or a write request
        message.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (command group messages): A set of command group
        messages consists of all messages M satisfying either of the
        following two conditions:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='format (C%d) ' counter='command'>
          <t>M is a command message</t>
          <t>M is a response message and there exists a command
          message C such that the following holds:
          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
          M.reqid = C.reqid
          M.tdst  = C.tsrc
          M.tsrc  = C.tdst
          (M.time - C.time) < t

            </figure>
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The parameter t defines a maximum timeout for response messages.
      </t>

      <t>
        This definition requires that the response message originates
        from the transport endpoint over which the request message has
        been received. This is not strictly required by SNMP transport
        mappings and in particular the UDP transport mapping allows to
        send responses from different transport endpoints. While
        sending response messages from a different transport endpoint
        is legal, it is also considered bad practice causing
        interoperability problems since some management systems do not
        accept such messages.
      </t>
      <t>
        It was decided to require matching transport endpoints since
        doing so significantly simplifies the procedures below and
        avoids accidentally confusing requests and responses.
        Implementations responding from different transport endpoints
        will lead to (a) a larger number of requests without related
        responses (and likely no retries) and (b) a similarly large
        number of responses without a matching request. If such
        behavior can be detected, the traces should be investigated
        and if needed the transport endpoints corrected.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (notification group messages): A set of
        notification group messages consists of all messages M
        satisfying either of the following two conditions:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='format (N%d) ' counter='notification'>
          <t>M is a notification message</t>
          <t>M is a response message and there exists a notification
          request message N such that the following holds:
            <figure>
              <artwork><![CDATA[
          M.reqid = N.reqid
          M.tdst  = N.tsrc
          M.tsrc  = N.tdst
          (M.time - N.time) < t
          ]]></artwork>
            </figure>
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The parameter t defines a maximum timeout for response messages.
      </t>

      <t>
        We again require that the transport endpoints match
        for notification group messages.
      </t>

    <section anchor="traces" title="Traces">
      <t>
        Traces are (large) sets of SNMP messages that are the result
        of recording SNMP traffic using a single traffic recording
        unit (e.g., using tcpdump) on a network segment carrying
        traffic of one or more managers and agents. Traces being used
        in the remainder of this document may be altered as a result
        of anonymization, which may result in some message information
        loss.
      </t>
      <t>
        Definition (trace): An SNMP trace (or short "trace") T is an
        ordered set of zero or more SNMP messages M. All messages M in
        T are chronologically ordered according to the capture time
        stamp M.time.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="flows" title="Flows">
      <t>
        Definition (flow): A flow F with parameter t is the set of

      <t>
        <list style='format (F%d) ' counter='flow'>
          <t>
            All response messages originate from a single network

            All non-response messages originate from a single network
            endpoint.
          </t>
          <t>
            All messages are either command group messages with
            parameter t or notification group messages with parameter
            t.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Subsequently, we call flows containing only command group
        messages command flows. Similarly, we call flows containing
        only notification group messages notification flows.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that it is possible that response messages of a trace
        cannot be classified to belong to any flow. This can happen if
        request messages triggering the response messages were not
        recorded (for example due to asymmetric routing) or because
        response messages were originating from transport endpoints
        different from the endpoint used to receive the associated
        request message.

      <t>
        Definition (flow initiator): A flow initiator is the network
        endpoint of the two endpoints involved in a flow, which is
        responsible for sending the first non-response message.

        This definition of a flow is mostly consistent with the
        definition of a flow used in <xref target="SPHSM07"/>. The
        difference is that the tool used to generate the data reported
        in <xref target="SPHSM07"/> did only require that the network

    <section anchor="slice-prefix" title="Slice Prefix">
      <t>
        As noted in the beginning of this document, it is desired that
        slices can be tested for equality/comparability. This is where
        the slice prefix comes in. The slice prefix has as a sole
        purpose to provide one of the means to compare slices. Using
        the slice prefix and a few other parameters (which will be
        discussed later on in this document) of a number of slices,
        one can determine which slices should be considered 'equal'
        and which of them are incomparable. This will assist in the
        process of finding potentially other relations.
      </t>
      <t>
        The slice prefix is a set of OIDs. This set is constructed
        from the messages that make up a single slice. So, for
        example, a slice that is the result of a manager requesting
        the contents of a particular table (with OID alpha) on an
        agent using a simple single varbind GetNext walk, starting at
        the table OID alpha, shall yield a slice prefix which consists
        of the OID alpha.
      </t>
      <t>
        Because the aim is to compare various slices using the slice
        prefix (along some other characteristics of a slice), this
        implicitly suggests the need to know whether a number of
        slices are the result of the same behaviour (i.e., specific
        configuration) of the initiating party of these slices. For
        example, one may want to know whether a number slices that
        involve a single manager and a single agent were the result of
        just one specific configuration of that manager. Multiple
        slices, that may all be initiated by that same manager and
        each slice possibly occurred in different polling instances,
        may in fact be the result of the same specific configuration
        of that particular manager. So, since in this case the
        specific configuration of the manager is only relevant for
        determining the behaviour, the slice prefix should be
        constructed based on OIDs in messages originating from that
        manager only. More generally, only the messages within slices
        that are sent by the initiating party (the non-response
        messages) are considered for the determination of the
        respective slice prefix of a slice.
      </t>
      <t>
        The resulting set of OID prefixes will represent the behaviour
        of the respective initiating party of that slice. This allows
        us to compare different slices.
      </t>
      <t>
        Following is a short introductory example which depicts what a
        slice could consist of and how one could determine the slice
        prefix in such a general case.
      </t>
      <t>
        Consider the case of a single manager A polling a specific
        agent B. More specifically, the manager A is configured to
        retrieve the complete contents of two columns alpha and beta
        of a some table. The resulting slice may contain the following
        messages:
      </t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Message | Direction | PDU type        | OIDs
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
    0        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha, beta
    1        B -> A    Response          alpha.0, beta.0
    2        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha.0, beta.0
    3        B -> A    Response          alpha.1, beta.1
    4        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha.1, beta.1
    5        B -> A    Response          gamma.0, delta.0
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
   ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        The manager starts with a GetNext request referencing two
        OIDs, alpha and beta. The agent B replies in message 1 with
        the first items of each of the referenced columns. The manager
        in turn goes on obtaining data from these two columns until it
        receives message 5, which indicates that the manager has
        received all of the data from the two columns.
      </t>
      <t>
        It can be easily concluded that the manager was configured to
        retrieve the contents of the two columns alpha and beta (the
        slice prefix). A different slice involving the same manager
        and agent and that is again the result of the same
        configuration of the manager, should be considered 'equal' to
        this one because the two slices are the result of the same
        behaviour. It should however be mentioned that such a second
        slice might contain a different number of messages, since the
        contents of the tables on the agent side might have changed
        over time. This underlines the previously made remark that
        only the messages originating from the initiating party should
        be considered in this process, because they will (in such a
        scenario) always illustrate the same behaviour of the
        initiating party.
      </t>
      <t>
        The previous example now makes it possible to give a more
        formal definition of a slice prefix. This is accomplished by
        first defining a slice signature which then leads to the
        definition of a slice prefix.
      </t>

      <t>
	Definition (slice signature): A slice signature S.sig of a
	slice S is a set of OIDs derived from the OIDs contained in
	the non-response messages of a slice.  This set S.sig consists
	of the following OIDs:
            <figure>
              <artwork><![CDATA[
case S.type = GetNext or S.type = GetBulk:

     S.sig =       U    (N.oids)  -      U    (R.oids)
                 N in S                R in S
             N is non-response      R is response

otherwise:

     S.sig =       U   (N.oids)
                 N in S
             N is non-response
		]]></artwork>
            </figure>
      </t>

      <t>
	Definition (slice prefix): The slice prefix S.slice of a slice
	S is the set of OID prefixes found in the slice signature
	S.sig. /* xxx */
      </t>

<!--
   Note that this definition is equal to the definition of the slice
   prefix with the additional requirement that no OID in S.sig is a
   child of any other OID in S.sig.

   This definition states that all OIDs in the first non-response
   message are considered part of the resulting slice signature S.sig.
   In addition to that, S.sig also contains those OIDs that have been
   newly introduced in non-response messages (that occurred later than
   the first one). Newly introduced OIDs are considered as such if they
   were not included in any of the responses. Besides that, all newly
   introduced OIDs that are a child OID of any of the OIDs in S.sig,
   shall not be considered part of S.sig. An example where this would
   be the case is newly introduced OID 1.2.3.4 where 1.2.3 is already
   in S.sig. The reason for this will become apparent in the sequel.

      <t>
        Following is an example to illustrate the definitions just
        described: Consider the case that a single manager A polling
        an agent B. More specifically, the manager A is programmed to
        retrieve the complete contents of two single column tables
        alpha and beta. Besides that, the manager now also requests
        the sysUpTime in the first request the manager sends to B. A
        resulting slice may contain the following messages:
      </t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[

    1        B -> A    Response          sysUpTime.0, alpha.0, beta.0
    2        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha.0, beta.0
    3        B -> A    Response          alpha.1, beta.1
    4        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha.1, beta.1

      <t>
        The slice prefix is determined as follows:
	<list style="numbers">

	    The union of all OIDs in non-response messages is the
	    following set:

          </t>
          <t>
            The union of the OIDs in response messages is the the
            following set:

            </figure>
          </t>
          <t>
            Substracting the two sets results in the slice signature
            S.sig:

       S.sig = N - R = { sysUpTime, alpha, beta }
              ]]></artwork>
            </figure>
          </t>
	  <t>
	    Since none of the OIDs in S.sig is a prefix of any other
	    OID in S.sig, the slice prefix is equal to the slice
	    signature:
            <figure>
              <artwork><![CDATA[
       S.prefix = { sysUpTime, alpha, beta }

            </figure>
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	This set of OIDs describes the behavior of the initiating
	party of this particular slice. Within the context of the
	described configuration of the initiating party is it apparent
	that a subsequent polling instance of the mentioned manager A
	polling agent B will result in the same slice signature.
      </t>

      <t>
        Following is a more elaborate slice for which the slice prefix
        is determined. Consider again the case that a single manager A
        is set to poll a specific agent B. Manager A is programmed to
        retrieve some values from B. A single slice may contain the
        following messages:

	This slice has a number of interesting properties:

	    The element beta.2 exists because the manager was trying
	    to 'fill' a 'hole' in a table. Since these holes reside in
	    the tables on the agent side and may change dynamically,
	    they do not really help in describing the behavior of the

	    Since beta is a prefix of beta.2, the slice prefix becomes

       S.prefix = { alpha, beta, sysUpTime }

            </figure>
	    The slice prefix does not include beta.2 anymore and thus
	    a manager retrieving the same columns alpha and beta with

          <t>
            At least one object identifier in the sequence of requests
            at the same varbind index must be increasing
            lexicographically while all object identifiers at the same
            varbind index have to be non-decreasing.

      <t>
        Definition (strict walk): A walk W is a strict walk if all
        object identifiers in the sequence of requests at the same
        varbind index are strictly increasing lexicographically.
        Furthermore, the object identifiers at the same index of a
        response and a subsequent request must be identical.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (prefix constrained walk): A walk W is a prefix
        constrained walk if all object identifiers at the same index
        have the same object identifier prefix.  This prefix is
        established by the first request within the walk.

        Definition (concurrency): Two slices A and B of a given flow F
        are concurrent at time t if A.start &lt;= t &lt;= A.end and
        B.start &lt;= t &lt;= B.end.
      </t>
      <t>
        Definition (flow concurrency level): The concurrency level of
        a flow F at time t is given by the number of concurrent slices
        of F at time t.
      </t>
      <t>
	Definition (slice initiator concurrency level): The
	concurrency level of a slice initiator I at time t is given by
	the number of concurrent slices initiated by the slice
	initiator I at time t.
