          The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) started an
          activity to collect traces of the Simple Network Management
          Protocol (SNMP) from operational networks. To analyze these
          traces, it is necessary to split potentially large traces
          into more manageable pieces that make it easier to deal
          with large data sets and simplify the analysis of the data.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document provides some common definitions that have
          been found useful for implementing tools to support trace
          analysis. This document mainly serves as a reference for the
          definitions underlying these tools and it is not meant to
          explain all the motivation and reasoning behind the
          definitions. Some of this background information can be
          found in other research papers.

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The Simple Network Management Protocol (SMMP) was introduced
        in the late 1980s. Since then, several protocol changes have
        taken place, which have eventually led to what is known today
        as the SNMP version 3 framework (SNMPv3) <xref
        target="RFC3410"/><xref target="RFC3411"/>. Extensive use of
        SNMP has led to significant practical experience by both
        network operators and researchers. However, up until now only
        little research has been done on characterizing and modeling
        SNMP traffic.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since recently, network researchers are in the possession of
        network traces, including SNMP traces captured on operational
        networks. The availability of SNMP traces enables research on
        characterizing and modeling real world SNMP traffic. However,
        experience with SNMP traces has shown that the traces must be
        large enough in order to make proper observations. A more
        detailed motivation for collecting SNMP traces and guidelines
        how to capture SNMP traces can be found in <xref
        target="ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Unfortunately, the analysis of large SNMP traces can take a
        large amount of processing time. Therefore, it is often
        desirable to focus the analysis on smaller, relevant sections
        of a trace.  This in turn requires a proper way to identify
        these smaller sections of a trace. This document describes a
        number of identifiable sections within a trace which make
        specific research on these smaller sections more practical.
        The following figure shows the various sections of traces and
        how they relate to each other.

      <t>
        This document defines the various entities (boxes) shown in
        the above figure. These definitions can be implemented by
        tools that can split SNMP traces into smaller sections for
        further analysis.
      </t>
      <t>
        The most central entity in the figure above is an SNMP trace,
        consisting of a potentially large set of SNMP messages. An
        SNMP trace is the result of recording SNMP traffic on a
        specific network for a specific time duration. Such a trace
        may, depending on the number of hosts in the respective
        network, contain SNMP messages exchanged between possibly many
        different SNMP engines. The messages contained in a trace may
        be represented in different formats. For the purpose of this
        document, the simple comma separated values (CSV) format
        defined in <xref target="ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE"/> contains
        sufficient information to split a trace into smaller sections.
      </t>
      <t>
        The SNMP messages belonging to an SNMP trace may have been
        exchanged between many different SNMP engines running on
        different hosts. Therefore, a first obvious way of separating
        a trace into smaller sets of SNMP messages is the separation
        of a trace into flows. Each flow contains only those SNMP
        messages of an SNMP trace that have been exchanged between two
        network endpoints. Such a separation may be necessary in case
        one wants to analyze specific SNMP traffic characteristics
        (e.g., number of agents managed by a management station) and
        wants to rule out network endpoint specific behaviour (e.g.,
        different SNMP management stations may have different polling
        configurations).
      </t>
      <t>
        Flows within traces can still be quite large in terms of the
        number of messages they contain. Therefore, it is necessary to
        split a flow into even smaller sections called slices. A slice
        contains all SNMP messages of a given flow that are related to
        each other in time and referenced information. Splitting a
        flow into slices makes it possible to separate SNMP messages
        within traces that belong to each other, like for example all
        messages that belong to a single polling instance involving a
        single manager and a single agent.
      </t>
      <t>
        A slice may contain, for instance, the exchanged SNMP messages
        between an agent and a manager which polls that agent in a
        single polling instance. The manager may even be set to poll
        multiple agents on a periodic basis. Therefore, multiple
        slices, which are possibly part of multiple flows, may all be
        related to each other, because they comprise a single polling
        instance, initiated by a single manager. The combined set of
        these related slices form slice sets.
      </t>
      <t>
        Slices can be of a specific form. For example, slices
        containing a sequence of linked GetNext or GetBulk requests
        are commonly called an SNMP walk. Note that only a subset of
        all slices will be walks.
      </t>

    <section anchor="messages" title="Messages">

      <t>
        SNMP messages carry PDUs associated with well defined specific
        protocol operations <xref target="RFC3416"/>. The PDUs can be
        used to classify SNMP messages. Following are a number of
        definitions that help to classify SNMP messages based on the
        PDU contained in them. These definitions will be used later on
        in this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        Notation: Let M be a message. We denote the properties of M as
        follows:
      </t>
      <figure>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
   M.type    = operation type of message M (get, getnext, ...)
   M.class   = class of message M (according to RFC 3411)

   M.tdst    = transport layer destination endpoint of message M
   M.nsrc    = network layer source endpoint of message M
   M.ndst    = network layer destination endpoint of message M
   M.reqid   = request identifier of message M

   M.values  = values listed in varbind list of message M
   ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        Note that the properties of a message can be easily extracted
        from the exchange formats defined in RFC XXXX
        <xref target="ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (read request message): A read request message is a
        message M containing a PDU of type GetRequest, GetNextRequest,
        or GetBulkRequest.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (write request message): A write request message is
        a message M containing a PDU of type SetRequest.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (notification request message): A notification
        request message is a message M containing a PDU of type
        InformRequest.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (notification message): A notification message is a
        message M containing a PDU of type Trap or InformRequest.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (request message): A request message is a message M
        which is either a read request message, a write request
        message, or a notification request message.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Definition (response message): A response message is a message
        M containing a PDU of type Response or of type Report.
      </t>

      <t>
        Note that Report messages are treated like Response messages
        since the SNMPv3 specifications currently use Report messages
        only as an error reporting mechanism, always triggered by the
        processing of some request messages. In case future SNMP
        versions or extensions use Report messages without having a
        request triggering the generation of Report messages, we may
        have to revisit the definition above.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (non-response message): A non-response message is a
        message M which is either a read request message, a write
        request message, or a notification message.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (command message): A command message is a message M
        which is either a read request message or a write request
        message.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (command group messages): A set of command group
        messages consists of all messages M satisfying either of the
        following two conditions:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='format (C%d) ' counter='command'>
          <t>M is a command message</t>
          <t>M is a response message and there exists a command
          message C such that the following holds:
          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
          M.reqid = C.reqid
          M.tdst  = C.tsrc
          M.tsrc  = C.tdst
          (M.time - C.time) < t
          ]]></artwork>
            </figure>
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The parameter t defines a maximum timeout for response messages.
      </t>

      <t>
        Note that this definition requires that the response message
        originates from the transport endpoint over which the request
        message has been received. This is not strictly required by
        SNMP transport mappings and in particular the UDP transport
        mapping allows to send responses from different transport
        endpoints. While sending response messages from a different
        transport endpoint is legal, it is also considered bad
        practice causing interoperability problems since several
        management systems do not accept such messages.
      </t>
      <t>
        It was decided to require matching transport endpoints since
        doing so significantly simplifies the procedures below and
        avoids accidentally confusing requests and responses.
        Implementations responding from different transport endpoints
        will lead to (a) a larger number of requests without related
        responses (and likely no retries) and (b) a similarly large
        number of response messages without a matching request. If
        such behavior can be detected, the traces should be
        investigated and if needed the transport endpoints corrected.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (notification group messages): A set of group
        notification messages consists of all messages M satisfying
        either of the following two conditions:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='format (N%d) ' counter='notification'>
          <t>M is a notification message</t>
          <t>M is a response message and there exists a notification
          request message N such that the following holds:
            <figure>
              <artwork><![CDATA[
          M.reqid = N.reqid
          M.tdst  = N.tsrc
          M.tsrc  = N.tdst
          (M.time - N.time) < t
          ]]></artwork>
            </figure>
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        The parameter t defines a maximum timeout for response messages.
      </t>

      <t>
        Note that we again require that the transport endpoints match
        for notification group messages.

        Traces are (large) sets of SNMP messages that are the result

        traffic of one or more managers and agents. Traces being used
        in the remainder of this document may be altered as a result
        of anonymization, which may result in some message information
        loss.

        Definition (trace): An SNMP trace (or short trace) T is an

        <list style='format (T%d) ' counter='trace'>

      <t>
        Note that it is possible that response messages of a trace
        cannot be classified to belong to any flow. This can happen if
        request messages triggering the response messages were not
        recorded (for example due to asymmetric routing) or because
        response messages were originating from transport endpoints

        This definition of a flow is mostly consistent with the
        definition of a flow used in <xref target="SPHSM07"/>. The
        difference is that the tool used to generate the data reported
        in <xref target="SPHSM07"/> did only require that the network

    <section anchor="slice-prefix" title="Slice Prefix - (more thoughts needed)">
      <t>
        As noted in the beginning of this document, it is desired that
        slices can be tested for equality/comparability. This is where
        the slice prefix comes in. The slice prefix has as a sole
        purpose to provide us one of the means to compare
        slices. Using the slice prefix and a few other parameters
        (which will be discussed later on in this document) of a
        number of slices, we can determine which slices should be
        considered 'equal' and which of them are incomparable. This
        will assist in the process of finding other relations later
        on.
      </t>
      <t>
        The slice prefix will represent a set of referenced OID
        prefixes.  Such a set is constructed based on the messages
        that make up a single slice. So, for example, a slice that is
        the result of a manager requesting the contents of a
        particular table (alpha) on an agent, shall yield a slice
        prefix which consists of just alpha. This, because every
        referenced OID in that slice will have a single common OID
        prefix: alpha. [DISCUSS: This is ambiguous since I get
        retrieve the table in a such a way that the prefix is not
        alpha.]
      </t>
      <t>
        Because we want to compare different slices using the slice
        prefix (along some other characteristics of a slice), we
        implicitly want to know whether a number of slices are the
        result of the same behaviour from the initiating party of
        these slices. For example, we want to know whether a slice
        initiated by a specific manager is the result of a specific
        configuration of that manager which polls one or more
        agents. As a result multiple slices, that may all be initiated
        by that same manager and possibly in different polling
        instances, may in fact be the result of the same programmed
        behaviour of that particular manager. Hence, we only consider
        the messages within slices that are sent by the initiating
        party: the non-response messages. Subsequently, these
        non-response messages shall be analyzed in order to determine
        the proper resulting set of common OID prefixes for that
        slice.
      </t>
      <t>
        The resulting set of OID prefixes will represent the purpose
        of that slice, allowing us to compare different slices for
        equality/comparability.
      </t>
      <t>
        Assume the following: Mnon_resp1 and Mnon_resp2 are two
        consecutive non-response messages of a slice (which have
        unequal request identifiers) and that Mresp1 and Mresp2
        represent any response message to each of the respective
        non-response messages.
      </t>

      <t>
        Definition (slice prefix): A slice prefix P is a set of OID
        prefixes derived from the OIDs contained in the non-response
        messages of a slice. This set P consists of the following
        OIDs:
        <list style='format (SP%d) ' counter='sliceprefix'>
          <t>
            Each OID x in Mnon_resp2 of a slice that is not in any
            response Mresp1 to the previous non-response message
            Mnon_resp1 (where Mresp1.time < Mnon_resp2.time for each
            of these response messages in Mnon_resp1) and x is not
            already in P and there exists no OID in P that makes up a
            part (starting from the beginning) of x.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

        algorithm for determining the slice prefix of a particular
        slice is summarized.

        Following is an example to illustrate the algorithm just
        described: Consider the case that a single manager A is set to
        poll a specific agent B. More specifically, the manager A is
        programmed to retrieve the complete contents of two single
        column tables alpha and beta.  Besides that, the manager also
        requests the sysUpTime in the first request the manager sends
        to B. The resulting set of messages within a single slice of
        this flow may contain the following messages:
      </t>

        These six messages make up a single slice. Determining the
        slice prefix for this slice goes as follows:
      </t>
      <t>
        At the start the set of found common OID prefixes P is still
        empty.  The algorithm starts looking for the first
        non-response message, which is message 0. It then attempts to
        find the response messages that happened before message 0,
        that are the result of the previous non-response message. At
        this stage, no other response can be found, because message 0
        is the first request of this slice.  Then, the algorithm
        attempts to find larger OIDs in P that can also be found in
        message 0 (like for instance 1.3.6.1 is larger than
        1.3.6). This is not the case, so it carries on with testing
        the OIDs in P for equality with any of the OIDs in message 0.
        No matching OIDs can be found, which in turn results in the
        algorithm adding the three OIDs of message 0 to P.
      </t>
      <t>
        The algorithm then goes on with the second message, which is a
        response, so it goes to the third message. Since this message
        contains only OIDs that can be found in message 1 (a response
        to the previous non-response), the algorithm will not consider
        the OIDs in message 2 any further. The same goes for the
        remainder of the non-response messages in this slice.
      </t>
      <t>
        This example slice would therefore result in a slice prefix
        consisting of the OID prefixes sysUpTime, alpha, beta.
